# To-do-List : Task List with Vue.js

A simple mini-project that uses Vue.js to create a to-do list. The user can add and remove tasks from the list.

## How to use

1. Open the file `index.html` in your web browser.
2. You will see an interface for adding and deleting tasks.
3. To add a task, type the text in the input field and press Enter.
4. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the page structure and user interface.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file containing the Vue.js application code.

## How it works

1. We've created a Vue.js instance with a div having the "app" ID as its attachment point.
2. The `newTask` property represents the input field for adding a new task.
3. The `tasks` property is an array that stores the list of tasks.
4. The `addTask` method adds a new task to the list if the field is not empty.
5. The `removeTask` method removes a task from the list using its index.

## Customisation

If you want to customise the application or add new features, you can modify the code in the `index.html` and `app.js` files. Feel free to explore the advanced features of Vue.js to extend the project.

Have fun with your Vue.js to-do list!
